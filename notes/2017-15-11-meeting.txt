SUMMARY:

Debriefing after LR submission and shifting gears to talk about a Kafka
replacement system.

NEXT STEPS:

- Implement a kafka shim for Spark, so that we can test our pub/sub system in
  the monitor team's pipeline.


Some reactions:

- what we learned from LR submission:
    - what we can can/can't say about HW
    - what kind of stateful queries we can implement

- What should our next steps be? Robert has two suggestions:
    1. Implement a pub/sub system with John Ousterhout for granular computing
    2. Implement a kafka shim that can be tested in the monitor team's pipeline
