SUMMARY:

We discussed the limitations of implementing linear road on the switch, and
then other applications that would be better suited, like high throughput
pubsub and routing.

NEXT STEPS:

- Implement pub/sub replacement for AMQ

Some reactions:

- It's possible to implement some scaled-down Linear Road queries
- For other queries, too much state is needed
- We should find applications that require constant amount of state on the
  switch
- Maybe routing applications are better suited for the switch
- Robert: could we do granular computing?
    - descriptive way of routing to many small endpoints
- We could do load balancing with state
- Could we do NIDS? Or would that require too much state?
- For throughput experiments, we can look at Antonio's 2017 Eurosys paper:
  http://www.inf.usi.ch/carzaniga/papers/rpkmcc_eurosys17.pdf
- We should find an application that uses AMQ/Kafka and drop in our switch
  version to see performance benefits
- We will have to implement reliable delivery
- Where do you measure throughput? Send or receive side?
