Date: 27th September 2017
Attendees: Theo, Antonio, Nate, Robert

SUMMARY:

We brainstormed: how to specify a schema to the compiler (either separately or
in the form of P4 annotations); and how to match aggregate operators in the
pipeline. Nate will meet with Jane Street, so we discussed what we would like
to show them, as well as what we'd like to learn from them.

NEXT STEPS:

- Nate will work on separating the generic P4 code from the P4V codebase, and
  on Friday will work with Theo to integrate this into our compiler.

- Prepare slides for Nate's Jane Street meeting. We can re-use some existing
  slides, and add a slide with questions we have for them.

Some reactions:

- We could add annotations to the P4 header, which would serve as a schema.
  This way, we wouldn't have to invent a schema language, and have the user
  provide yet another file to the compiler. By annotating the headers in P4, it
  would be easier to maintain the code, because the header definitions and
  schema would be in the same place.

- Nate will work on separating the P4V code from the generic P4 code, so that
  we can use it in our compiler for parsing annotations (and generating code).

- Antonio thinks that the schema should be separate from the P4 code with the
  header and parser. This would mean that the user wouldn't have to see the P4
  code when writing the schema. However, the user has to write the header and
  parser in P4 anyway.

- As a first step, we will not support comparing two expressions, e.g.
  add_order.price > AVG(add_order.price) has expressions on both sides.
  We will start off with a constant on one side, e.g. AVG(add_order.price) > 10

- Nate has a meeting with Jane Street, so we should help prepare slides for it.
    - the last slide should have a bunch of questions to open discussion
        - What could we add to the language to make it useful?
        - What are the typical queries?
        - What % of ITCH messages are batched?

- Robert learned from Rolf that messages are batched because it lowers load for
  end-hosts. However, in practice, most messages are not batched.
