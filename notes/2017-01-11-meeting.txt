SUMMARY:

Discussed outline for Linear Road paper and what our pitch should be.

NEXT STEPS:

- Robert is going to start working on the intro and discussion
- Masoud and Theo are going to work on the HW implementation

Some reactions:

What should the pitch be for our Linear Road paper?
- Nate: we shouldn't root it in any app, but use LR as a representative 
  benchmark
- How to improve dataplane programming? Add stateful computation
    - propose enhancements to better support stateful programs
    - to understand what abstractions you need, we need a good case study:
      stream processing, specifically LR

Paper outline:
- background on P4
- describe LR
- discuss implementation
- evaluation: throughput, and upper bound on latency

Antonio: sketch what we'd like to see from dataplane programming
    - what primitives would we like to see? Both in arch + lang

- Pitch of the paper: how do we do stateful processing with hardware designed for
  networking?
- What's the essence of the difficulty?
    - high level changes that we'd like from HW + P4 lang

Antonio: what abstractions would stateful computing need on the switch?
    - Context. With per-action context, we could do stateful more easily
    - This would require a execution model for concurrency
