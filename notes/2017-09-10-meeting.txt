SUMMARY:

We discussed how to express aggregate operators in our language, and how they
would be implemented.

NEXT STEPS:

- Theo will add to the spec the necessary to generate a P4 program that
  computes aggregagates. Then, expand a query's action to have an operator that
  updates an aggregate.


Some reactions:

- for aggregates, we need to select the packets on which to compute the
  aggregate
- we can use the existing query language to select the packets
- we should look at CQL for how stream processing queries are implemented:
  https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1146463
- start off implementing COUNT, SUM, then EWMA
- After we have that try implementing the Linear Road example that other stream
  processing systems implement as a benchmark
- we will start off by updating the state on the switch (e.g. aggregates), then
  we will work on packet transformations, so we can do stream transformations
